# 🔐 Python-Based Keylogger for Security Research

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a simple **Python-based keylogger** designed for educational and research purposes. The keylogger captures and logs all keystrokes made by a user and stores them in a text file (`keylog.txt`). It handles common and special keys like **space**, **enter**, and **decimal** for clear readability.

This project aims to help cybersecurity students and professionals understand how keyloggers work, how attackers might use them, and how defensive mechanisms can be developed to detect and prevent them.

## 🎯 Features
- ✅ **Real-Time Keystroke Logging**  
  Logs every keypress and appends it to a file.

- ✅ **Handles Special Keys**  
  Converts special keys like `space`, `enter`, and `decimal` for better readability.

- ✅ **Lightweight and Simple**  
  Written in Python using minimal dependencies.

- ✅ **Security Research Focused**  
  Meant for learning purposes such as malware analysis and improving defensive techniques.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** 
  - `keyboard` (for capturing key events)
  - `datetime` (optional, used here for timestamp reference)

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The script starts by displaying a welcome message.
2. It then listens for keystrokes and logs them to a file called `keylog.txt`.
3. Special keys are processed for better readability (e.g., `[ENTER]`, ` ` for space).
4. The keylogger stops when the `esc` key is pressed.

## 🚀 Usage Instructions
> ⚠️ **Note:** Only run this script in a controlled environment (such as your lab or testing VM) and with proper authorization. This project is for educational purposes only.

1. **Install the required library**:
   ```bash
   pip install keyboard

**Run the script:**
    python keylogger.py

**Check the log file:**
    The captured keystrokes will be saved in keylog.txt in the same directory.
